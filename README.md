# Hi, I'm Piotr Szaran

I'm a **Statistics major** and **CS + Math graduate from the University of Toronto**. After finishing school I took a short break, but I’ve continued learning through self-directed projects and freelancing. I primarily build **web apps** and do **full-stack** work.

## What I do
- Full-stack web development (with a focus on building practical, shippable products)
- Freelance websites (many of these repos are private)
- I like picking a problem and learning whatever I need to solve it

## Websites i've dveloped
- https://www.nextlvltherapy.com/

## Tech I use
- **Next.js** (primary) and TypeScript
- Comfortable jumping into new tools/frameworks as needed

## What I'm looking for
I'm currently targeting **Web Developer / Full-Stack** roles.

## A bit more about me
Outside of coding: **outdoors**, **Rocket League**, and the **gym**.
